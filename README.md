# Integrate a virtual mirror with e-commerce products

Virtual try on apps have the full potential to become the next big thing in e-commerce. They relieve much of the stress of going into a store and physically try on different products. They save consumers’ time and brands’ budget, serving as a cost-effective yet convenient alternative for trying on products.Most importantly, it makes choosing products we'll love as easy as watching in the mirror.

In this code pattern, we will develop a hybrid mobile application using IBM Mobile Foundation integrated with recommendation system , which takes in age and gender as input and based on this, it returns a personalized recommendation of jewellery products. The user can later try these jewellery products virtually using the virtual mirror feature.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Connect to IBM Mobile Foundation using a mobile application.
* Take inputs from mobile application and do required processing on IBM Cloud.
* Deploy and use cloud foundry applications.
* Access images from Cloud Object Storage using a mobile application.
* Connect and access Db2 on Cloud.
* Setup a recommendation engine and integrate it with mobile application.

## Flow

1. Take input from user's mobile.
2. The input is passed via IBM Mobile Foundation.
3. IBM Mobile Foundation passes the user's input to the recommendation engine.
4. Recommendation engine interacts with IBM Db2 to get the necessary product details for the recommended products.
5. Images of the recommended products is retrieved from Cloud Object Storage.
6. Recommendation engine returns the images and details of the recommended products to the user's mobile application.
7. User can click on virtual mirror button to access virtual mirror.
8. IBM Mobile Foundation passes the user's input to the virtal mirror application.
9. Virtual mirror application gives access to the user.
10. User can view the virtual mirror.
