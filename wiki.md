# Summary

In the era of Digital Transformation, Augmented Reality is one of the interactive experience of a real-world environment. A Jewellery Store would have evolved from Local Store to Online Store but the trial of jewellery products was not possible. With the help of strong recommendation engine, mobile platform and an Augmented Reality based face tracking, A virtual Mirror can serve the purpose of not only superimposing the jewellery on customers face but also increase their sales by recommending products based on their relevance.

* [Augmented Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality): Augmented reality (AR) is a type of interactive, reality-based display environment that takes the capabilities of computer generated display, sound, text and effects to enhance the user's real-world experience.

# Description


The Internet has changed the way we live our lives in major ways and in simple ones, from how we connect with our loved ones to how we order our food. In the commerce space, consumers are more informed than ever and while online shopping is a ubiquitous thing, the data every shopper has access to at their fingertips or in their pockets has even changed the game for in-store purchases.As digital transformation grows more prominent with each passing day, e-commerce will grow bigger and better as shopping from home becomes easier and friendlier.

Shopping is not an activity anymore. Its an experience, where fashion and retailers are trying to give a more personalised experience to each customer through services like virtual mirrors.A virtual mirror can help get a good idea how a hat or a pair of spectacles or a piece of jewellery will look on a person. In this tech world every third person in the world has a smartphone and that is the reason M-commerce is flourishing. Technology is influencing every part of market and one of them is jewellery. Jewellery app with try on virtual mirror give the customers an approach through which they can feel much better.

In this code pattern, we will develop a hybrid mobile application using Mobile First Foundation integrated with recommendation system based on Watson Visual Recognition , which takes in an image of the user as an input and based on his/her features(like age, gender, etc), it returns a personalized recommendation of jewellery products. The user can later try these jewellery products virtually using the virtual mirror feature.

# Flow

1. Take input from user's mobile.
2. Send the input to the recommendation system application via Mobile First Foundation.
3. Interact with the Db2 on Cloud to get details of the required products.
4. Send the recommended products to the to the user's mobile via Mobile First Foundation.
5. Send the input to the Virtual Mirror application via Mobile First Foundation and visualize on virtual mirror.

# Announcement

Try-on at home is a great way to hook customers. But the shipping costs makes brands lose profit. Virtual try-on not only saves on return shipping costs. But also allow brands to help customers to find a perfect product.

Virtual try on apps have the full potential to become the next big thing in e-commerce. They relieve much of the stress of going into a store and physically try on different products. They save consumers’ time and brands’ budget, serving as a cost-effective yet convenient alternative for trying on products.Most importantly, it makes choosing products we'll love as easy as watching in the mirror. 

But the problem in present world is, Virtual try ons available on mobile are short in numbers. They are limited to one platform (iOS) and work fine only on top-level devices. What about those who are on $100 Androids?

Hence in this code pattern, we will develop a hybrid mobile application using Mobile First Foundation integrated with recommendation system based on Watson Visual Recognition , which takes in an image of the user as an input and based on his/her features(like age, gender, etc), it returns a personalized recommendation of jewellery products. The user can later try these jewellery products virtually using the virtual mirror feature.
